# George-the-Discord-Bot
George is a simple Discord bot I made to learn about chatbots and so my friends and I could have a bot on our server.  He has no direct purpose, but he can reply to some questions and statements made to him.

George is powered by the Discord.js Framework and if you would like to use this code you will need to find a way to fill in the token variable with the your bot's token.  I load my token from a file that is not in this repo.  This bot was made for my personal use so, it would most likely need modifications for your use.
